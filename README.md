# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points.
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points.
### Step 2: 
Mention the coordinates as given.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Assign the values of coordinates in the formula.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:

import math as m
l1=[4,2]
l2=[10,6]
d=m.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(d))

  


### OUTPUT:


### RESULT:
Thus findings of distance between two points are successfully executed.
